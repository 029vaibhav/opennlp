0.6.2
-----
Improved the build system for easier homepage updates.

Simplified the Lexicon and Rules interfaces and pushed the methods
intended for generation into the ReversibleLexicon and ReversibleRules
interfaces which extend Lexicon and Rules, respectively.



0.6.0
-----
A bunch of changes have happened since 0.4.0, but were unfortunately
not documented in this file during that time.  Here are the major
changes:

The various interfaces were broken up and placed into directories
such as "generate" and "structure" reflecting their grouping.

A number of the classes in the opennlp.common.structure package were
redesigned to be less specific to categorial grammar

A new package opennlp.common.hylo was added with the beginnings for
Java structures representing terms of hybrid logics.

The class opennlp.common.xml.SchemaBasedValidator was added for
making it easy to validate an XML file against an XML Schema.

OpenNLP now uses Ant to build, and the directory structure has been
changed considerably to facilitate the creation of the distribution
files and to ensure that source code and supporting libraries are
always provided with the distribution.


0.4.0
-----
* First release version separated from Grok!
* Addition of XML and preprocessing interfaces.
* Cleaned up many interfaces in main package so that they had fewer
  Grok specific methods.
* Documentation of the interfaces (= API documentation)
