<h2>Dictionary within OpenNLP</h2>

<p>
Dictionary is a sub-project of the OpenNLP project. It is intended to
act as an interface in which various dictionary resources can be added.
The initial dictionary resource is based on <a
href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> and uses the WordNet
1.7 English language database. Future plans include adding more dictionary
resources, perhaps including more languages, but definitely including
lists of proper nouns of various categories (names, companies, etc.)
</p>

<p>
Dictionary is designed to fit in with the other projects in OpenNLP,
in particular it can be used to obtain synonyms, antinyms, frequency
data, etc. as part of the preprocessing tagging for Grok.
</p>




<h2>The OpenNLP Dictionary Java standard: opennlp.dictionary</h2>


<p>The OpenNLP Dictionary project defines a set of Java interfaces based
on those from <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/">Gate 2.0</a>.
</p>


<p>
The latest version of the <code>opennlp.dictionary</code> package can be
downloaded <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3368">here</a>.

<h2>OpenNLP Dictionary history</h3>

<p>
Version 0.1.0
OpenNLP Dictionary was initially coded during March 2002 by Mike
Atkinson borrowing heavily from the 'c' source provided with <a
href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet 1.7</a>. These
have been translated into Java and simplified and speeded up in
the process. Using StringBuffer, a small cache of recently retrieved
data, the Java code is an order of magnitude faster than the 'c' code
(who said Java is slow?). The hard-limits on most of the buffers have
been removed, so some things now work which caused a buffer overflow
in the 'c' version.
