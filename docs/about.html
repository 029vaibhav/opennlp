<h2>Organizational role of OpenNLP</h2>

<p>
OpenNLP is meant to provide an umbrella for various <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">open source</a> NLP projects to work
with greater awareness and (potentially) greater interoperability.
These projects could be vastly different and have little to do with
each other, but the idea is to have a basic infrastructure in place
for researchers and developers to collaborate on open source NLP
projects.  In this way, OpenNLP can be thought of as a <a
href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a>-like organization.  Also, like GNU,
OpenNLP provides a top-level name package name for Java programs
(opennlp.*) so that Java developers can have sensible package names
which will be unique.
</p>

<p>
It is hoped that one day OpenNLP will be one of the major sites for
cutting edge open source NLP software where people can find the
software they need and get help on using and developing it.  The
current members are not advocacy crazy, so please do not feel left out
if you already have an open source NLP project and we have not
contacted you.  We have just set the ball rolling and look forward to
others joining in and increasing the level of interaction.
</p>



<h2>The OpenNLP Java standard: opennlp.common</h2>


<p>The OpenNLP project defines a set of Java interfaces and implements
some basic infrastructure for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
components.  There are currently many NLP systems and programs
available, but those which are freely available are generally too
tightly integrated, limited to very specific tasks, or toyish in their
capabilities to easily incorporate into other systems (they also often
are not open source, even though they are free).  OpenNLP would
attempt to forge a standard which will facilitate code re-use in NLP
(as such standards have done for other areas), and help focus and
propel NLP developers to cooperate in building robust, highly
functional <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open source</a> NLP
components.
</p>

<p>
OpenNLP is being designed to provide many different levels of
granularity since NLP tasks can be cut up in many different ways.
Part of the solution for this has been to have interfaces which have
basic methods for tight integration, and higher level methods which
use XML documents to pass linguistic information between loosely
coupled components.
</p>


<p>
The latest version of the <code>opennlp.common</code> package can be
downloaded <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3368">here</a>.
Looking at the <a href="api/index.html">API</a>, one will notice
several sub-packages such as <code>opennlp.common.parse</code> and
<code>opennlp.common.structure</code>.  These packages contain
interfaces for fairly specific components which were extracted from
Grok <http://grok.sourceforge.net/>. The code for Grok will probably
be the best guide to how OpenNLP has been used.  Of course, the
<code>opennlp.common</code> package grew from Grok, so there are still
idiosyncracies in it which should be rooted out at some point.
Hopefully, other projects will start working with the API to help us
further define and refine it, and make it more general.
</p>

<p>
Probably the most important packages are
<code>opennlp.common.preprocess</code> and
<code>opennlp.common.xml</code>.  It is in these packages that one can
see better where we envision OpenNLP standards heading.  This is where
we have big components that are linked together through passing of XML
documents and/or very specific methods.  For example, the Tokenizer
interface requires an implementation to be able to do two things: 1)
process an NLPDocument and, using the XML definitions for the
document, mark up the tokens appropriately; 2) take a String and
return a String[] with each of the tokens as an element in the array
(For example "Mr. Brown, my teacher, likes spam." should become
[Mr.|Brown|,|my|teacher|,|likes|spam|.]  (using "|" as an array
delimiter for this example)).  The idea for now is that by providing
methods for both high-level (XML) and low-level data passing, we can
get around some of the problems of modularity and portability that
large NLP systems often suffer from.
</p>

<p>
Our hope is that by defining an API such as this, we can encourage
others to build more NLP components which can work together.  As
Computational Linguistics students, we are all too aware that students
keep reinventing a lot of these things, which means less time
advancing the state of our academic knowledge, and more time kludging
together code that often is only an approximation for the task in
hand.  The open source "revolution" appears to us to be a way of
getting around this situation much more efficaciously.
</p>

<h2>OpenNLP and XML Schemas</h3>

<p>
Partly because Java and XML go hand and hand, but also because XML is
programming language independent, we envision XML become more and more
important in defining standards for OpenNLP.  The latest version of
<code>opennlp.common</code> at the time of this writing is 0.6.0,
which uses XML in important ways but does not take advantage of many
new XML resources since that part of the package is virtually
unchanged from version 0.4.0.  The plan is to move towards defining
XML Schemas to declare data types separately of the coden and thereby
get away from OpenNLP's currently Java-centric nature.  XML entities
conforming to the schemas can then be marshalled into Java objects in
the <code>opennlp.common</code> package.
</p>

<p>
We would like to conform with some of the XML standards that are being
defined for natural language data and data structures, but don't
always really have the time to examine them very closely.  Take for
example the <a
href="http://hal2001.itakura.toyo.ac.jp/~chiekon/nlpxml/">XML for
NLP</a> workshop to be held on 30 November 2001 and the <a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/acadapps.html#tei">Text Encoding
Initiative</a>.  Any help towards this end would be very welcome.
</p>




<h2>OpenNLP history</h3>

<p>
OpenNLP is an offshoot of the <a
href="http://grok.sourceforge.net/">Grok</a> system, which is a large
scale, open source NLP system that started life at the University of
Edinburgh.  The initial <code>opennlp.common</code> interfaces were
abstracted from Grok, but now they are being developed
independently. As many interfaces as possible are implemented by Grok
modules, providing a demonstration of the feasibility of OpenNLP
standards and architectures. At first, OpenNLP was just the Java API
of interfaces for NLP components and was part of the Quipu project as
the package <code>quipu.opennlp</code>.  With the creation of the <a
href="http://leonlp.sf.net">Leo</a> project, it was decided that
OpenNLP was a better banner name than Quipu for an organizational
entity to encourage open source NLP development and collaboration.
The <code>quipu.opennlp</code> package then became
<code>opennlp.common</code>, and others such as
<code>quipu.grok</code> and <code>quipu.maxent</code> became
<code>opennlp.grok</code> and <code>opennlp.maxent</code>,
respectively.
</p>

<p>
OpenNLP is thus moving into a new stage of existence.  We are very
open to suggestions and new members.  So if you take the time to look
at our stuff and find yourself saying "why don't they use this" or
"they could be doing that", then please come on board and change it!
